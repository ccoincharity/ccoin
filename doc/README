Intro
-----
charity is a free open source project derived from many coin sources, with
the goal of providing a long-term sea voyage across the rough seas of crypto-currency.
Built from Bitcoin, PPCoin, NovaCoin, charity, and BlackCoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake, 
messaging systems, help further advance the field of crypto-currency.
